# Button

[Material Design Documentation](https://material-web.dev/components/button/)

Buttons help people initiate actions, from sending an email, to sharing a document, to liking a post.

## Filled Buttons

Filled buttons have the most visual impact after the FAB, and should be used for important, final actions that complete a flow, like Save, Join now, or Confirm.

## Outlined Buttons

Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are important, but aren’t the primary action in an app.  
Outlined buttons pair well with filled buttons to indicate an alternative, secondary action.

## Text Buttons

Text buttons are used for the lowest priority actions, especially when presenting multiple options.  
Text buttons can be placed on a variety of backgrounds. Until the button is interacted with, its container isn’t visible.
